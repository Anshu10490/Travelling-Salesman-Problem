# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) aims to determine the shortest route for a salesman to visit each city once and return to the start. This project examines algorithms to optimize TSP, reducing travel cost and time. TSP applications include logistics and supply chain management for efficient route planning.
